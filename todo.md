# To do

* Automate creation of left/right side ports for connectors
* Add simple connectors (ferrules, cable lugs)
  * no pinout
  * graphical representation?
* Add support for cable splicing (as connector type)
* Display picture of connector underneath (including pin 1 location)
* Create parser (to make WireViz work as a GraphViz extension)
